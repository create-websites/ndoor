    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Gold & Blue Accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page narrative scroll, guiding the user from the "what" to the "so what." It begins with high-level summary cards (The Mission), details the core arguments (The Case), presents the main data via an interactive global response section (The Reaction), and concludes with a balanced assessment (The Verdict). This structure was chosen to make a complex diplomatic report easily digestible, allowing users to explore different facets of the campaign logically and interactively. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Mission Stats (Goal: Inform): HTML/CSS "stat cards" for key numbers (delegations, countries) for immediate impact. 2. Evidence Showcase (Goal: Organize): An interactive accordion built with HTML/JS to present the different categories of evidence (complicity, successful strikes). Justification: This segments dense information into manageable, user-triggered sections. 3. Global Response (Goal: Compare/Explore): A tabbed interface where clicking a country's button dynamically displays their specific reaction. Justification: This is the most effective way to present the report's core comparative data, allowing users to actively explore and contrast the varied international responses. 4. Delegation Breakdown (Goal: Proportions): A Chart.js Donut chart to visually represent the regional focus of the diplomatic missions. Justification: Provides a quick visual summary of the campaign's geographic priorities. Library: Chart.js/Canvas. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                Following its military action, India launched an unprecedented diplomatic campaign. The goal: to shape the global narrative, present irrefutable evidence of Pakistan's role in terrorism, and build an international coalition to hold Islamabad accountable. This was a projection of national unity and a test of India's diplomatic influence.

                India's diplomatic offensive was a well-executed campaign that achieved some key objectives but fell short on others. It successfully projected a message of national unity and communicated a new, more assertive security doctrine. However, it also revealed the limits of converting military success into immediate diplomatic victories.

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">🇺🇸 Cautious De-escalation</h4>
                    <p>The US response was primarily focused on preventing further escalation. President Trump and Secretary of State Rubio called for restraint from both sides. However, Trump's claim to have personally mediated the ceasefire was controversial, seen by some as undermining India's diplomatic autonomy. While some US experts praised India's military professionalism, Washington's official stance remained cautious, re-engaging with Pakistan's military to ensure stability.</p>`,
                'china': `
                    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">🇨🇳 Predictable Support for Pakistan</h4>
                    <p>Beijing's reaction was aligned with its "all-weather" ally. The Chinese Foreign Ministry called India's strikes "regrettable" and urged calm, while deflecting questions about providing intelligence support to Pakistan. This denial was contradicted by French intelligence reports alleging that China ran a coordinated disinformation campaign to undermine the performance of the French-made Rafale jets used by India.</p>`,
                'russia': `
                    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">🇷🇺 Concern and Solidarity</h4>
                    <p>Moscow expressed "serious concern" and urged restraint. However, in meetings with the Indian delegation, Russian officials strongly condemned the Pahalgam terror attack and affirmed that Russia "stands in solidarity with India for elimination of terrorism in all its forms," signaling a more supportive stance than other major powers.</p>`,
                'un': `
                    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">🇺🇳 Call for Restraint</h4>
                    <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for "maximum military restraint," warning that the world could not afford a major conflict. The UN condemned the initial terror attack, but in what was seen as a diplomatic setback for India, Pakistan was later elected to chair the UNSC's Taliban sanctions committee, highlighting the complexities of UN politics.</p>`,
                'others': `
                    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">🌍 Other Nations</h4>
                    <p>The response from other nations was varied. <strong>Israel</strong> provided explicit support, affirming India's right to self-defense. The <strong>UAE</strong> and <strong>Japan</strong> called for restraint but acknowledged the need to counter terrorism. Most of India's immediate neighbors in South Asia remained silent on the operation, preferring not to take sides in the regional dispute.</p>`
